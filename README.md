# Peaq Pallet MOR

### Introduction

The peaq MOR pallet supports the distribution of rewards to machine owners. Block rewards generally distributed by the block-reward-pallet, but the percentage given to machine owners are further distributed by this pallet. Currently rewards are payed once for registering new machines to the network, and frequently for being online on the network frequently.
